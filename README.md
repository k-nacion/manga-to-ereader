## Procedure

### 1. Downloading Manga with Hakuneko

1. **Visit a manga website** (e.g., [Mangadex](https://mangadex.org), [Mangafire](https://mangafire.to)). For this guide, weâ€™ll use [Mangakatana](https://mangakatana.com) as an example.

2. **Select a manga** you want to download and copy its URL. Example: [Jigokuraku (KAKU Yuuji)](https://mangakatana.com/manga/jigokuraku-kaku-yuuji.19894).

3. Open **Hakuneko** and:
   - Select the source.

   - Press the refresh button to load the manga link.  ![Hakuneko Refresh](attachments/Hakuneko%203.png)

4. **Download chapters**:
   - Click the manga to load its chapters.
   - Use the download button to download all chapters, or select specific chapters by clicking the cloud icons.  ![Hakuneko Options](attachments/Hakuneko%204.png)
   - Optionally, bookmark the manga for easy access later.

All downloaded files will be saved to the directory configured in Hakuneko.

### 2. Combining CBZ Files

If you have multiple CBZ files and want to read seamlessly, use the **CBZ Combiner**.

1. Open **CBZ Combiner**.
2. Copy the directory containing the CBZ files for the manga.
3. Set the maximum output file size (recommended: 250 MB). This ensures compatibility with the KCC plugin, which cannot process files larger than ~300 MB.
4. The combiner will generate files in a new directory: `output/[manga_name]_[index].cbz`.
5. You now have combined CBZ files ready for conversion.

### 3. Converting CBZ to MOBI

**Note**: The configuration below is a suggestion. Feel free to adjust settings in the KCC plugin to suit your needs.

**Requirement**: Output file format must be MOBI or AZW3.

1. Open **KCC Plugin**.

3. Click the **Convert** button to process the files.

4. Once conversion is complete, you will have MOBI files ready for uploading to your E-Reader.

### 4. Uploading MOBI Files to an E-Reader

1. Open **Calibre**.  
2. Drag and drop the MOBI files into Calibre.
3. Connect your E-Reader device via USB.
